The User Diet Analysis Application is an intelligent system designed to assist users in determining a suitable dietary plan based on a specific health goal they define, such as weight gain, weight loss, maintenance, or muscle building. This is achieved by suggesting a set of meals tailored to the inputs provided by the user, including weight, age, height, medical conditions, and the desired goal. The proposed plan adheres to recognized medical standards, ensuring its appropriateness for the user’s needs.
